# ü§ñüìàüìä project #2 assignment

For this assignment, you will conduct exploratory analysis on a few datasets and present your findings with polished visualizations. You will work in Python using a Jupyter notebook, using `pandas` for your initial analysis. To create visualizations, you may use `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or a combination of the 2 libraries.

You may start with the following steps:

1. Download and explore the climate datasets below.
2. Examine the datasets' basic attributes and determine a research question or 2 that you would like to answer about the data. What relationships do you hope to explore between various attributes? What trends do you wonder about? What uncertainties do you have about the dataset that you want to explore?
3. Research any basic aspect of the dataset that you need - what do all the attributes (columns) mean to the domain (subject matter)? Do you understand what all the attributes and variables mean? What context do you need to understand about the domain subject matter itself? Do you need to do outside reading?
4. Explore with rough visualizations, dataframes, and `pandas` analysis. Please show all work. 
5. Finalize **2 visualizations** that help answer your initial questions, and _tells a story_ with the data.
6. Write a short report about your process, your conclusions, and your final visualizations, including any further questions you have about the data. (This written element should be 500-700 words.)

## datasets!

- üåé **climate, global land temperatures dataset**
  - 3 tables: temperatures by major city, country, and global overview, 1750-recent
  - [download dataset](https://github.com/mab253/dataviz_fall24/tree/main/project1-datasets/climate-datasets)
  - sources: [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/) + [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)
 
- üåé **climate, annual and monthly temperature anamoly, global composite dataset**
  - (we started working on this one in class to create the warming stripes)
  - https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/data/HadCRUT.5.0.2.0/download.html 

**üí• remember, you do not have to visualize every attribute! what columns will you focus on to tell a unique story?** \
have fun!

## üîé evaluation criteria

Your work will be evaluated based on your analysis process, final visualizations, and your short report. In general I am looking for:
  - Clear research questions related to the data 
  - Relevant data transformation in pandas
  - Breadth of analysis, exploring multiple questions
  - Depth of analysis, with appropriate follow up questions
  - Clear explanation of your process and choices in your report  
  - 2 final visualizations are polished, they can "stand alone" and **tell a story**
  - Expressive and effective visualizations, good design choices based on what we've learned (color, shape, other channels, etc.)!
  - Clear and relevant captions, titles, axes, and any other necessary labels
  - You may research new methods beyond what we've covered in class if you wish, including _light_ use of generative AI tools, **_with citations_**! ([see here](https://github.com/mab253/dataviz_fall25/blob/main/ai-citations.md))

## ‚úâÔ∏è submit your work 
  - Your exploratory analysis, code, and initial rough graphics should all be cleanly organized in 1 Jupyter notebook.
  - Your final standalone graphics should also be in the same notebook, clearly marked as your 2 final visualizations.
  - The short report text can also be inside the same Jupyter notebook, at the end after your final visualization renderings.
  - Please use [this form](https://airtable.com/app8wCIzUG0DBWhOq/shrIq5NZ9oRwrSePb) to submit your work **by Oct. 21st, 11:59pm.**
