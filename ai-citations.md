# ü§ñ on A.I. use

This is an evolving topic - as a coder myself, I have been experimenting with light generative AI use in my workflow, and I understand that it's possible that a big part of anyone's coding (or writing, working, etc.) life in the future might involve smart use of these tools. **However**, as you are students learning to code, I have concerns about what you "skip over" in your brain when you leap to asking AI to solve the problem. I have had students in the past say that it feels like an addictive habit, something that might help you solve a last-minute lab problem late at night before the deadline, but over time can hinder you actually knowing how to code. When you hit a roadblock in your thinking, which is a natural part of programming, the next step can't always be to look up an easy answer. We need to understand _how_ and _why_ our code works - and further, in order to use these tools well in the future, we need to be able to learn to prompt with the _right_ questions. As scientists and engineers, we also need to understand _how large language models (LLMs) work_, and when they don't, before we start using them seriously! We will talk a lot more about this during the semester. 

That said: I know these tools are out there and being used. They are changing and (possibly) improving all the time. I can only highly encourage you to use generative AI tools sparingly. When you do turn to it, I suggest using it mostly as a tutor, asking conversational questions to deepen your understanding of the material rather than asking the bot to generate answers. 

### **üí• In this class, you will need to cite WHENEVER and HOWEVER you use generative AI tools (chatGPT, etc.) to improve your code or come up with a solution. üí•**

Example: 

```
/* -----
This code was written with the aid of ChatGPT;
when prompted 'how do I overload a constructor in my class?'
the generated text helped me write the following code:
accessed: Aug. 2025
 -------- */
```
*You do not need to follow this format exactly, but your comment should cite the same information (prompt, source, and date if possible)*

**üí•‚û°Ô∏è This commenting and citation of code is NOT OPTIONAL.** If you do not cite code where you have copied either the exact lines or the inspiring method from a bot, this could be considered **plagiarism** in the context of this class, on homework exercises, labs, assessments, or projects. **The consequences for failing to cite AI or other external sources in this class can include failing the assignment, or indeed failing the course.** 

**What about code found online?**
If you have used code that comes from any other programmer, you also need to cite this explicitly. You can write a comment directly above where this code starts, and cite the source by including the project name, the programmer's name (if known), and a link to where you found this code. Include the date that you found it, if possible.

For example: 

```
/***********
  This code was adapted from:
  David Bowie
  https://github.com/davidjonesbowie/the_exact_file_where_you_found_the_.code
  Accessed: Sept. 2025
*************/
```
*You do not need to follow this format exactly, but your comment should cite the same information (name, link/source, and date if possible)*

In written language for a paper, we also cite when it's not a direct quote, but it is an *idea* that we learned from a specific source. If you have parts of your code that fit this description, please comment and cite here as well. 

Example:

```
/* The following method is inspired by work done by Proton the Cat,
Jupyter notebook available @ https://github.com/proton-the-cat */
```
You do not need to cite the textbook (zyBooks) or class notes - I am assuming most of the methods that you are learning are coming from there! 

**When in doubt, cite. If you have any questions about this or want clarification, please ask.**
